    "\n",
    "**Definition of functions:**  \n",
    "Python instead of many languajes does not use {} for functions or any kind of ifs, instead it uses **:** at the end of the *if/for/def* statemens and uses tabs to index each start and finish.   \n",
    "\n",
    "**End of functions and data-types**  \n",
    "There are no semicolons **;** to endlines on this languaje and there is no need to set the data type before hand.   \n",
    "To ensure a function ended, just make sure the indentation is below the function on the same level on the start def and we leave a empty line.  \n",
    "For example, we dont need to set int number = 20, we just do number = 20 and thats it.  \n",

    "**Comments:**   \n",

    "### Best Practices\n",
    "**Naming:**   \n",
    "In python we must name things as this 5 cases:\n",
    "- Variables, Functions, Methods, Packages, Modules : *lower_case_with_underscores*\n",
    "- Classes and Exceptions: *CapWords*\n",
    "- Protected Methods and Internal Functions: *_single_leading_underscord(self, ...)*\n",
    "- Private Methods: *__double_leading_underscore(self, ...)*\n",
    "- Constants: *ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES*\n",
    "\n",
    "We should avoid one letter vars, they must be self explanatorial (We can do it on short blocks).\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for e in elements:\n",
    "    e.test()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Also when naming, we should use the elements name first example:\n",
    "\n",
    "elements = ...   \n",
    "elements_active = ...  \n",
    "elements_defunct = ...  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Indentation:**  \n",
    "We should set a consistent amount of indentation to make sure we are on the correct line.  \n",
    "Google good practices uses a set value of 2 spaces per tab, making it always the same no matter the IDE.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Boolean comparision:**  \n",
    "As we do on C++ or any other languaje, we should not use *a == True* to check if a boolean is indeed true, we should simply let the value itself be checked.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**List Comprenhension:**  \n",
    "We should use list comprehension when possible:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = [1,2,3]\n",
    "b = []\n",
    "for i in a:\n",
    "    if i > 2:\n",
    "        b.append(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This can be rewritten as:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = [1,2,3]\n",
    "b = [i for i in a if i > 2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "**With keyword:**  \n",
    "The usage of *with* makes sure that when finishing using a file it gets closed.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('file.txt') as f:\n",
    "    do_some\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Imports:**  \n",
    "We should import all the module, not simple parts. \n",
    "**Use of comments:**  \n",
    "The code must be self explanatory so we don't need to use comments on every part of the code to explain simple things. "

    "### Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "In python there are different data structures: \n",
    "- Arrays\n",
    "- List\n",
    "- Dicts\n",
    "- Tuples\n",
    "- Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lists:**  \n",
    "Lists are made to store multiple items in a single variable.  \n",
    "The list items are ordered, changeable and allow duplicates, so if I add an item to the list it will be appended to the end.  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "cars = [\"car1\", \"car2\", \"car3\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "To add items we can use: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "cars.append(\"toyota\")\n",
    "cars.insert(1,\"toyota\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "While append inserts the element on the last index, insert does it on the desired index. \n",
    "\n",
    "To remove items we use: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "cars.pop() #Removes last\n",
    "cars.pop(1) #Removes 2nd\n",
    "cars.remove(\"car1\") #Removes car1 el\n",
    "del cars[0] #Removes first\n",
    "cars.clear() #Empties list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Other commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cars.sort() #Orders asc\n",
    "cars.sort(reverse = True) #Orders desc\n",
    "cars.sort(key=str.lower) #Case insensitive order\n",
    "cars.reverse() #Reverses the current order\n",
    "cars.copy() #Copies list\n",
    "cars.index(x) # Returns first index of the element\n",
    "cars.count(x) # Returns count of x in the list \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Arrays:**  \n",
    "Arrays are not native from python but we can use lists as arrays like this: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "cars = [\"car1\", \"car2\", \"car3\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "And we can access them by: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "cars[0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Keep in mind the length is equal to the amount of items, but to access the first or last item is: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "length = len(cars)\n",
    "first = cars[0]\n",
    "last = cars[length-1]\n",
    "last = cars[-1] #This also works\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tuples:**  \n",
    "Tuples are used to store multiple itmes in a variable.\n",
    "Tuple is ordered and unchangeable, so we cannot add, remove or change items after it was created.  \n",
    "It does allow duplicates.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are created by: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "cars = (\"car1\", \"car2\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "We access the same as we did on lists/arrays, the only functions we can use are count and index.  \n",
    "To mutate a tuple we need to create an array and them make it a tuple using *tuple()* function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sets:**  \n",
    "Sets are unordered, unchangeable (Can add and remove but not change) and unindexed and they do not allow duplicates.\n",
    "They are created like this:  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "cars = {\"car1\", \"car2\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can only access the items through a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cars.add(\"car3\") # Adds car3 to the set\n",
    "cars.remove(\"car3\") # Removes car3 from the set\n",
    "```\n",
    "To join them we use: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "cars.union(cars2)\n",
    "cars | cars2 # works too\n",
    "cars.update(cars2) # Adds all them to cars and updates the original\n",
    "cars.intersection(cars2) #Keeps only common\n",
    "cars.difference(cars2) #Keeps only different from first set to others\n",
    "cars.symmetric_difference(cars2) #Keeps all items except duplicates\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dictionaries:**  \n",
    "A dictionary is ordered, changeable and do not allow duplicates.  \n",
    "They are created like:  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "thisdict = {\n",
    "    \"brand\":\"Test\",\n",
    "    \"model\":\"Test2\",\n",
    "    \"year\":1999\n",
