    "\n",
    "**Definition of functions:**  \n",
    "Python instead of many languajes does not use {} for functions or any kind of ifs, instead it uses **:** at the end of the *if/for/def* statemens and uses tabs to index each start and finish.   \n",
    "\n",
    "**End of functions and data-types**  \n",
    "There are no semicolons **;** to endlines on this languaje and there is no need to set the data type before hand.   \n",
    "To ensure a function ended, just make sure the indentation is below the function on the same level on the start def and we leave a empty line.  \n",
    "For example, we dont need to set int number = 20, we just do number = 20 and thats it.  \n",

    "### Best Practices\n",
    "**Naming:**   \n",
    "In python we must name things as this 5 cases:\n",
    "- Variables, Functions, Methods, Packages, Modules : *lower_case_with_underscores*\n",
    "- Classes and Exceptions: *CapWords*\n",
    "- Protected Methods and Internal Functions: *_single_leading_underscord(self, ...)*\n",
    "- Private Methods: *__double_leading_underscore(self, ...)*\n",
    "- Constants: *ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES*\n",
    "\n",
    "We should avoid one letter vars, they must be self explanatorial (We can do it on short blocks).\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for e in elements:\n",
    "    e.test()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Also when naming, we should use the elements name first example:\n",
    "\n",
    "elements = ...   \n",
    "elements_active = ...  \n",
    "elements_defunct = ...  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Indentation:**  \n",
    "We should set a consistent amount of indentation to make sure we are on the correct line.  \n",
    "Google good practices uses a set value of 2 spaces per tab, making it always the same no matter the IDE.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Boolean comparision:**  \n",
    "As we do on C++ or any other languaje, we should not use *a == True* to check if a boolean is indeed true, we should simply let the value itself be checked.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**List Comprenhension:**  \n",
    "We should use list comprehension when possible:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = [1,2,3]\n",
    "b = []\n",
    "for i in a:\n",
    "    if i > 2:\n",
    "        b.append(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This can be rewritten as:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = [1,2,3]\n",
    "b = [i for i in a if i > 2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "**With keyword:**  \n",
    "The usage of *with* makes sure that when finishing using a file it gets closed.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('file.txt') as f:\n",
    "    do_some\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Imports:**  \n",
    "We should import all the module, not simple parts. \n",
    "**Use of comments:**  \n",
    "The code must be self explanatory so we don't need to use comments on every part of the code to explain simple things. "

    "### Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "In python there are different data structures: \n",
    "- Arrays\n",
    "- List\n",
    "- Dicts\n",
    "- Tuples\n",
    "- Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lists:**  \n",
    "Lists are made to store multiple items in a single variable.  \n",
    "The list items are ordered, changeable and allow duplicates, so if I add an item to the list it will be appended to the end.  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "cars = [\"car1\", \"car2\", \"car3\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "To add items we can use: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "cars.append(\"toyota\")\n",
    "cars.insert(1,\"toyota\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "While append inserts the element on the last index, insert does it on the desired index. \n",
    "\n",
    "To remove items we use: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "cars.pop() #Removes last\n",
    "cars.pop(1) #Removes 2nd\n",
    "cars.remove(\"car1\") #Removes car1 el\n",
    "del cars[0] #Removes first\n",
    "cars.clear() #Empties list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Other commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cars.sort() #Orders asc\n",
    "cars.sort(reverse = True) #Orders desc\n",
    "cars.sort(key=str.lower) #Case insensitive order\n",
    "cars.reverse() #Reverses the current order\n",
    "cars.copy() #Copies list\n",
    "cars.index(x) # Returns first index of the element\n",
    "cars.count(x) # Returns count of x in the list \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Arrays:**  \n",
    "Arrays are not native from python but we can use lists as arrays like this: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "cars = [\"car1\", \"car2\", \"car3\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "And we can access them by: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "cars[0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Keep in mind the length is equal to the amount of items, but to access the first or last item is: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "length = len(cars)\n",
    "first = cars[0]\n",
    "last = cars[length-1]\n",
    "last = cars[-1] #This also works\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tuples:**  \n",
    "Tuples are used to store multiple itmes in a variable.\n",
    "Tuple is ordered and unchangeable, so we cannot add, remove or change items after it was created.  \n",
    "It does allow duplicates.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are created by: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "cars = (\"car1\", \"car2\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "We access the same as we did on lists/arrays, the only functions we can use are count and index.  \n",
    "To mutate a tuple we need to create an array and them make it a tuple using *tuple()* function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sets:**  \n",
    "Sets are unordered, unchangeable (Can add and remove but not change) and unindexed and they do not allow duplicates.\n",
    "They are created like this:  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "cars = {\"car1\", \"car2\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can only access the items through a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cars.add(\"car3\") # Adds car3 to the set\n",
    "cars.remove(\"car3\") # Removes car3 from the set\n",
    "```\n",
    "To join them we use: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "cars.union(cars2)\n",
    "cars | cars2 # works too\n",
    "cars.update(cars2) # Adds all them to cars and updates the original\n",
    "cars.intersection(cars2) #Keeps only common\n",
    "cars.difference(cars2) #Keeps only different from first set to others\n",
    "cars.symmetric_difference(cars2) #Keeps all items except duplicates\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dictionaries:**  \n",
    "A dictionary is ordered, changeable and do not allow duplicates.  \n",
    "They are created like:  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "thisdict = {\n",
    "    \"brand\":\"Test\",\n",
    "    \"model\":\"Test2\",\n",
    "    \"year\":1999\n",

    "This should print 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The \\_\\_init\\_\\_() Function**  \n",
    "This function is always excecuted when initializing the class, this assings values to objects properties, like the constructor in Java.  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person: \n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "p1 = Person(\"Jhon\", 36)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The \\_\\str\\_\\_() Function**  \n",
    "This function controls what should be returned if the object is represented as a string. Like the ToString method in Java.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person: \n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object Methods:**  \n",
    "Objects can have methods, those are functions that belong to the object.  \n",
    "They are called inside the class and are used by the name of the method.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person: \n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",

    "**Self Parameter**  \n",
    "The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class.  \n",
    "We can call it whatever we want but it is standarized that we use self.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Modifications:**  \n",
    "We can modifiy directly them for example using *p1.age = 40*, also we can delete properties from the object by using *del* keyword or delete the object at all.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance**  \n",
    "This allows us to define a class that inherits all methods and properties from another class.  \n",
    "We have a **Parent Class** and a **Child Class**, this makes child inherit properties from parent class.  \n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "#Parent Class: \n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, fname, lname):\n",
    "    self.firstname = fname\n",
    "    self.lastname = lname\n",
    "\n",
    "  def printname(self):\n",
    "    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Child Class\n",
    "class Student(Person):\n",
    "  pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "We use pass when we dont want to add any new properties or methods to the class.  \n",
    "There Student class inherits init constructor and the printname function from Person.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Iterators**  \n",
    "We cam oterate through data using an iterator, an iterator is an object that contains a number of values.  \n",
    "It instead of the init or str, uses **\\_\\_iter\\_\\_()** and **\\_\\next\\_\\_()** methods.  \n",
    "We create them by using *iter()* function and move using *next()* like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mytuple = (\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Banana\")\n",
    "myit = iter(mytuple)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(next(myit))\n",
    "print(next(myit))\n",
    "print(next(myit))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This should get printed all the elements in the tuple.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Polymorphism**  \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that there are various methods/functions/operators that have the same name and can be executed on many objects or classes, for example we have *len()* function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This let us overwrite functions or methods when we inherit some method from another class.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
