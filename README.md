# Data Science Journey

## Who am I?

I'm Luis, a 24 years old advanced CS and statistics student.  
I'm currently working as a Web Scraper Analyst and did work as a Data Analyst before.  

## Objectives:
On this github I'm trying to relearn concepts from while back, use the market standard tech to achieve the same results I did while ago.  
I now how to do most of this things on R, but I want to learn how to do them on Python.  

Apart from this, I'm on a journey to master more of statistics, Machine Learning and Deep learning.  
To sum up the main objective is: 
- Learn something new on my free time
- Learn to transcript R to Python
- Master SQL
- Learn PowerBi and DAX
- Document all this journey from zero so this may help somebody one day.
- Start from the base and build up knowledge without skipping any steps.
- Don't use AI unless it is needed (I really don't want to use AI to learn this)
- Learn ML and DL
